						<p>We at Global Diligence are relentlessly persistent in reaching for and meeting very high goals which most people would consider unrealistic. We have no respect for the status quo. Anyone can deliver the status quo. Exceptional firms deliver exceptional results and that is Global Diligence, Obsessive attention to detail allows us to surprise and delight our clients.</p>
